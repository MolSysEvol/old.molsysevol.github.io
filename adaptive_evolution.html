              <p>By comparing sequences from distinct individuals it is possible to discover the mutations that occured in their ancestry.
	      How many of these mutations contributed to adaptation, however, is the topic of a long-running debate.
	      Our research aims at understanding which factors determine the occurrence of adaptive mutations along the genome.

	      <h2>Estimating the rate of adaptation at the molecular level</h2>

	      It is  possible to <q cite='#Moutinho2020'>gain insight about the rate of adaptive mutations by contrasting the mutation rate at distinct categories of sites (see [1] for review and references therein for a description of the methods)</q>:
	      at neutral sites, the fate of mutations is independent of their type, and the substitution rate (that is, the rate at which mutations <b>get fixed</b> in the population) is equal to the mutation rate (the rate at which mutations <b>appear</b> in the population).
	      At non-neutral sites, however, mutations that confer an advantage to the organism have a higher chance to become fixed in the population, leading to a higher substitution rate than the one at neutral sites.
	      Conversely, so called-deleterious mutations (mutations with a negative effect for the individuals that carry them) have a lower chance to become fixed, leading to a reduce substitution rate. Contrasting the rate of substitutions at neutral and non-neutral sites, therefore, allows the estimation of the strength and direction of selection, accounting for the underlying mutation rate.</p>
	      <p>In proteins, some mutations do not change the encoding amino-acid, owing to the degeneracy of the genetic code.
	      Such mutations are termed <b>synonymous</b>, as opposed to <b>non-synonymouns</b> mutations that change the underlying amino-acid.
	      As an approximation, one can consider that synonymous mutations are neutral, while non-synonumous ones are not.
	      A measure of selection in proteins is then given by the ratio of non-synonymous over synonymous substitutions, <b>dN/dS</b>, also termed <b>&omega;</b>.
	      The &omega; ratio, however, only represents an average of the selective forces acting on a protein.
	      Given the prevalence of purifying selection in protein evolution it will be generally negative, making it difficult to detect positive selection when it happens.</p>
	      <p>One way to estimate the part of the rate of substitutions that is adaptive is to combine sequences from distinct individuals from the same population with sequences from another species.
	      The non-synonymous substitutions between species can be seen as the sum of two substitution types: adaptive non-synonymous substitutions dN<sub>a</sub> and non-adaptive non-synonymous substitutions dN<sub>na</sub>.
	      The &omega; ratio can then be decomposed as 
	      \[\begin{eqnarray}
	      \omega &=& \frac{dN_a + dN_{na}}{dS}\\
	      &=& \frac{dN_a}{dS} + \frac{dN_{na}}{dS}\\
	      &=& \omega_a + \omega_{na}
	      \end{eqnarray}\]
	      </p>
	      Positively selected mutations will be fixed rapidly and will rarely be seen when comparing sequences within populations.
	      Deleterious mutations will be removed from the population, effectively reducing genetic diversity in the population.
	      As a result, polymorphism will be essentially determined by neutral and deleterious mutations, so that the ratio of non-synonymous polymorphism, <b>pN</b>, over synonymous polymorphism, <b>pS</b>, provides an estimation of &omega;<sub>na</sub>.
	      It results that \(\omega = \omega_a + pN/pS\). 
	      An estimation of the proportion of adaptive non-synonymous sustitutions, &alpha;, is then given by
	      
	      \[\begin{eqnarray}
	      \alpha &=& {\omega_a \over \omega}\\
	             &=& {\omega - pN/pS \over \omega}\\
		     &=& 1 - {pN/pS \over dN/dS}\\
		     &=& 1 - {pN.dS \over pS.dN}
	      \end{eqnarray}\]

	      This simple estimation, however, ignores the occurrence of mutations with mild effects, negative of positive, that segregates as polymorphism.
	      The rate of adaptive mutations is then underestimated. 
	      This caveat can be addressed by using models of distribution of fitness effects (DFE).
	      Model-based inferrence of adaptive substitution rate is a poweful method, which requires genome-sized datasets.
	      By fitting and comparing models on distinct gene sets, it is possible to correlate the rate of molecular adaptation with genomic factors such as recombination rates, gene function, expression level, etc.
